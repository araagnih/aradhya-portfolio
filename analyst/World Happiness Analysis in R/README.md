## 🧠 Methodology Workflow
![Workflow](visuals/pipeline_workflow.png)

**Workflow Overview:**
1. **Problem Definition** → Identifying key factors influencing happiness levels  
2. **Data Collection** → World Happiness Report datasets (2015–2019)  
3. **Data Wrangling** → Cleaning, merging yearly datasets  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Visualizing factor patterns  
5. **Statistical Analysis** → Correlation, regional, and temporal comparisons  
6. **Results & Insights** → Visual summaries, trends, and relationships  

> This workflow connects exploratory data analytics with statistical insights to explain *why* certain countries rank happier than others.
